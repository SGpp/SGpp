/**
 * This class provides functionality to conveniently add levels to a CombigridEvaluator.
 * It implements most of the functionality, however, the adaptive level generation strategy has to
 * be specified by deriving from this class and overriding the protected method computePriority().
 *
 * Via any LevelManager subclass, one can add levels adaptively or with a regular structure (bounded
 * 1-norm) to a CombigridEvaluator, and one can even choose to use multiple threads to precompute
 * the function values. Note that the parallelization only concerns the function evaluations and not
 * the other calculations. Thus, if your function can be computed in a very short amount of time
 * (for example (x, y) |-> exp(x) * sin(y)), the parallel evaluation might be slower than the normal
 * evaluation. Of course, if you choose to use parallel evaluation, you have to ensure that your
 * function supports multiple calls in parallel.
 *
 * The parallel evaluation functionality is designed to use all available computing power. In
 * particular, parallel adaptive level generation may also start computing levels before their
 * predecessors are finished, even though value of the level cannot be estimated as precisely as if
 * the predecessors were finished.
