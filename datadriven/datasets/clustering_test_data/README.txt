Description:
This synthethic dataset (clustering_testdataset_dim2.arff) consists of 10 clusters each consisting of 1100 datapoints. The points of each cluster are distributed with a 1D Gauss distribution around its cluster center in every dimension. The dataset further includes 100 datapoints of noise using a uniform distribution. Intended for usage in the unit tests since we know the correct solution.

Additional files:
There is also a file with the correct clustering assignement (cluster_erg.txt), a file with the k-nearest Neighbor Graph generated with this dataset (graph_erg_dim2_depth11.txt), two files about the sparse-grid density estimation using the dataset (rhs_erg_dim2_dept11.txt, mult_erg_dim2_depth11.txt) and finally a file with the density pruned k-nearest neighbor graph (graph_pruned_erg_dim2_depth11.txt).
