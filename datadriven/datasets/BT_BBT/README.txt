Test Datasets for supervised learning algorithms
================================================

One method to perform regression with sparse grids requires the setup of a system of linear equations where the system matrix is constructed by applying the basis functions of all grid points to all data points.

The datasets in this folder are used in test that validate the correctness of the matrix construction in the learners.
Multiple combinations of basis function type, dimensionality etc are represented in the datasets.
