INSTALLATION:
=============
Compilation of the libraries with scons by
> scons
in the main directory. scons needs the SConstruct file.

Settings for scons, like compiler flags e.g., can be specified in a
"custom.py"-file. An example-file is the "custom-example.py"-file
located in the same folder.

It is highly recommended to copy the custom-example.py to custom.py

If you have an scons version < 0.97.X (check via "> scons -version")
update it.
