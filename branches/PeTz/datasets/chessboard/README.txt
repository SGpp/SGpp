From:
Alexander Heinecke (Alexander.Heinecke@mytum.de)

Description:
A d-dimensional dataset, with uniformly distributed points (random) in
[0,1]^d. This points have two classes that are arranged like a chessboard.

Files:
create_dataset.py
  Creates datasets as whitespace separated list
create_scripts.py
  Creates script for converter.py to convert files into arff-format

The data files are not included but have to be created manually, as
they take too much storage space.
