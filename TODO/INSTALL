INSTALLATION:
=============
Compilation of the libraries with scons by
> scons
in the main directory. scons needs the SConstruct file.

Settings for scons, like compiler flags e.g., can be specified in a
"custom.py"-file. An example-file is the "custom-example.py"-file
located in the same folder.

It is highly recommended to copy the custom-example.py to custom.py

If you have an scons version < 0.97.X (check via "> scons -version")
update it.

LRZ-LINUX-CLUSTER:
==================

Download scons, swig

Install swig:
./configure --prefix=$HOME/utils
make && make install
Attention: SWIG is platform dependant (ia64, x86_64)

Install scons:
python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/utils

Add Environment Variables:
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/utils/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/utils/lib64/scons-VERSION

Build SGClass

Mac OS X:
========

SG++ can be compiled and used with Mac OS X (tested with
10.7 "Lion").

A standard linux environment has to be set up (e.g. using
macports) and the required tools (gcc, python, swig, scons) have
to be installed.

Some difficulties can arise as OS X (if the XCode Command
Line Tools are installed) can include some apple specific
versions of gcc and python.

For this reason it can be necessary to change the symlinks
in "/usr/bin/" to the compiler provided by the package
management system (e.g. /opt/local/bin/ for macports).

As there are basically two toolchains installed, it is
important to execute the binary with the libraries of the
toolchain the binary was build with. To this end ist can
be necessary to set the "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" environment
variable to a path that contains the standard library of
the toolchain used (e.g. /opt/local/lib for macports).
Also, the path to the libraries "libsgpp*" has to be
added to be added to "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" if the
libraries aren't added to a well known path (like
/usr/lib).

If the last steps are ommitted or some path is set
incorrect, hard to debug memory problems might arise.
Stack traces may be corrupted and the program might
terminate with different "malloc" errors.

There is guarantee that SG++ will work with icc on OS X.

Windows (cygwin):
=================

SG++ can probably be compiled on windows if cygwin  is used and
the appropriate tools (gcc, python, swig, scons) are installed.

There is no guarantee that SG++ will work on windows.
