Description: The sparse grids toolkit SG++
 SG++ is a collection of numerical algorithms for sparse grids. It
 contains modules for interpolation, quadrature, data mining
 (regression, classification, clustering), optimization, PDEs, and
 more. SG++ implements algorithms for spatially adaptive grids and
 also provides a module for the combination technique. Many of the
 implemented algorithms are also available as a high-performance
 version, often orders of magnitude faster than standard
 implementations.
