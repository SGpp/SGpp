Description: The sparse grids toolkit SG++
  SG++ is a collection of numerical algorithms for spars grids.
	It contains modules for interpolation, quadrature, data mining (regression, classification, clustering), PDEs and more. SG++ implements algorithm for spatially-adaptive grids and also provides a module for the combination technique. Many of the implemented algorithm are also available as a high-performance version, often orders of magnitude faster than standard implementations. This package provides python bindings for SG++.
