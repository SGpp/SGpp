@section guideline Guideline documenting the code
<div style="color:#FF0000;">All code has to be documented so that the functions,
classes and all other entities appearing in the Doxygen-webpage are
commented so that some \e other person can understand what they are
doing.</div>

Especially tags like \e \@todo should be used. They are then listed on the 
\link todo ToDo\endlink-page. 

Different scripts can be grouped together
in so-called Modules. The link to the Modules-page is shown in the navigation bar.

Please correct any warnings or errors that appear when creating the
documentation with doxygen!

@section unittests Unittests/Testing

In the subfolder <tt>tests</tt> there are @link tests the following@endlink 
unittests written in Python.
They can be tested separately or all together via the file
<tt>test_pyclass.py</tt>. If you modify existing code, do not forget 
to make sure that no new errors are introduced. If you write new
functionalities, do <i>always</i> add unittests for each functionality!


@section description Description of the SGClass package

Here comes the description...


@section doxygen Usage of Doxygen

Executing <tt>doxygen</tt> in the main folder creates the
Doxygen-documentation in the subfolder <tt>doc</tt>. The settings
for Doxygen are automatically taken from the file
<tt>Doxyfile</tt>. As those settings do some preprocessing to
include the revision numbers from the svn-Repository this requires the
use of <tt>svn</tt> and takes longer than normal execution.

Therefore a second file with Doxygen-settings exists, just without
the preprocessing steps, <tt>Doxyfile.fast</tt>, which is much
faster. It can be used running <tt>doxygen Doxyfile.fast</tt>
in the main folder.

The preprocessing steps include the substitution of the tags
<pre>
\@version&nbsp;$HEAD$
</pre> to show the current revision of the svn, and 
<pre>
\@version&nbsp;$CURR$
</pre> to additionally show the last revision, the current file 
changed and the last author working on the file. Additionally the tag
<pre>
$<tt>SVN_LOG</tt>$
</pre>
is substituted by a list of the last few check-ins, as shown above.
