SG++ is a toolbox allowing to employ spatially adaptive sparse grids
straightforward, flexibly, and without the vast initial overhead that
has to be spent when implementing sparse grids and the corresponding
algorithms. To be able to deal with different kinds
of problems in a spatially adaptive way - ranging from interpolation
and quadrature via the solution of differential equations to
regression, classification, and more - a main motivation behind the
development and all considerations was to create a toolbox which can
be used in a very flexible and modular way by different users in
different applications.

The main features of the sparse grid toolbox are efficiency and
flexibility, both of which can sometimes be nasty rivals, for example
if the reusability of an algorithm for different purposes requires
extra data structures or control mechanisms, thus slowing down special
algorithmic variants. To ensure performance at run-time, we use C++
for all performance critical parts. Considering flexibility, we have
spent a great deal in ensuring modularity, reusability and the
separation of data structures and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide
the means to use the SG++ toolbox from within Python, Matlab, Java,
and C++, of course.

To name a few special features:
- Different types of basis functions are supported which enable to
cope with the characteristics of special applications.
- Modern shared-memory multi-core systems are supported via OpenMP to
speed-up computations.
- Adaptive refinement criteria can easily specified as functor
objects.
- The underlying data structure (which is, per default, hash-based)
is encapsulated so that it can be exchanged by other choices.
- Template-based support for fast realizations of typical sparse-grid
algorithms that make use of the tensor product structure of the
underlying basis.

SG++ is open source software and delivered as source code. For

@section mainpage__overview Overview

- @subpage development
- @subpage manual

The documentation of the SG++ toolbox is structured in two main
parts. The first one, @ref development, addresses all those who
want to contribute to SG++ or who are involved in its
development. There, the styleguide can be found, references to useful
tools and utilities are provided, and a few issues that did arise at
the initial development at the Chair of Scientific Computing at the TU
Munich are gathered.

The second one, @ref manual, is dedicated to users of
SG++. For example, installation instructions are provided as well
as short use cases as a quick-start to using SG++.

@section mainpage__unittests Unittests/Testing

In the subfolder <tt>tests</tt> there are @link tests the following@endlink 
unittests written in Python.
They can be tested separately or all together via the file
<tt>test_pyclass.py</tt>. If you modify existing code, do not forget 
to make sure that no new errors are introduced. If you write new
functionalities, do <i>always</i> add unittests for each functionality!


@section mainpage__description Description of the SG++ package

Here comes the description...

@section mainpage__doxygen Usage of Doxygen

Executing <tt>doxygen</tt> in the main folder creates the
Doxygen-documentation in the subfolder <tt>doc</tt>. The settings
for Doxygen are automatically taken from the file
<tt>Doxyfile</tt>. As those settings do some preprocessing to
include the revision numbers from the svn-Repository this requires the
use of <tt>svn</tt> and takes longer than normal execution.

Therefore a second file with Doxygen-settings exists, just without
the preprocessing steps, <tt>Doxyfile.fast</tt>, which is much
faster. It can be used running <tt>doxygen Doxyfile.fast</tt>
in the main folder.

The preprocessing steps include the substitution of the tags
<pre>
\@version&nbsp;$HEAD$
</pre> to show the current revision of the svn, and 
<pre>
\@version&nbsp;$CURR$
</pre> to additionally show the last revision, the current file 
changed and the last author working on the file. Additionally the tag
<pre>
$<tt>SVN_LOG</tt>$
</pre>
is substituted by a list of the last few check-ins, as shown above.
