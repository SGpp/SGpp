/**
  * \page example_refinement_java Refinement Example
  *
  * Here we demonstrate how to refine a grid. As a refinement indicator, we take the surpluses
  * of the grid points directly.
  * We start with a regular sparse grid of level 3 with linear basis functions and refine five
  * times. In each refinement step, we refine the grid point with the highest absolute surplus.
  *
  * The following example interpolates the (non-symmetric) function
  * f : [0,1]x[0,1] -> R, f(x,y) := 16 (x-1) * x * (y-1) * y
  *
  * The number of grid points is printed in each iteration.
  * After refinement, the surplusses have to be set for all new grid
  * points, i.e., the alpha-Vector has to be extended.

 * There are clearly more efficient approaches than to set the function
 * values for all grid points and to hierarchize the whole grid each

 * available and suffices for demonstration purposes.
 *
 * This use of the SurplusRefinementFunctor takes as arguments the
 * coefficient vector (it doesn't have to be the coefficient vector, it
 * could be something modified!) and the number of grid points to refine
 * (if available). It bases its refinement decision on the absolute
 * values of the vector's entries, choosing the largest ones. Other
 * refinement functors are available or can be implemented.
