## To be able to quickly start with a toolkit, it is often advantageous
## (not only for the impatient users), to look at some code examples first.
## In this tutorial, we give a short example program which interpolates a
## bivariate function on a regular sparse grid.
## Identical versions of the example are given in all languages
## currently supported by SG++: C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB.
##
## For instructions on how to run the example, please see \ref installation.
##
## In the example, we create a two-dimensional regular sparse grid with level 3
## (with grid points \f$\vec{x}_j \in [0, 1]^2\f$)
## using piecewise bilinear basis functions
## \f$\varphi_j\colon [0, 1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}\f$.
## We then interpolate the function
## \f[
##   f\colon [0, 1]^2 \to \mathbb{R},\quad
##   f(x_0, x_1) := 16 (x_0 - 1) x_0 (x_1 - 1) x_1
## \f]
## with
## \f[
##   u\colon [0, 1]^2 \to \mathbb{R},\quad
##   u(x_0, x_1) := \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \alpha_j \varphi_j(x_0, x_1)
## \f]
## by calculating the coefficients \f$\alpha_j\f$ such that
## \f$u(\vec{x}_j) = f(\vec{x}_j)\f$ for all \f$j\f$.
## This process is called <i>hierarchization</i> in sparse grid contexts;
## the \f$\alpha_j\f$ are called <i>(hierarchical) surpluses</i>.
## Note that \f$f\f$ vanishes at the boundary of the domain \f$[0, 1]^2\f$;
## therefore, we don't have to spend sparse grid points on the boundary.
## Finally, we evaluate the sparse grid function \f$u\f$ at a point
## \f$\vec{p} = (0.52, 0.73)\f$.
##

## At the beginning of the program, we have to import the pysgpp library.
import pysgpp

## Before starting, the function \f$f\f$, which we want to interpolate, is defined.
f = lambda x0, x1: 16.0 * (x0 - 1.0) * x0 * (x1 - 1.0) * x1

## First, we create a two-dimensional grid (type sgpp::base::Grid)
## with piecewise bilinear basis functions with the help of the factory method
## sgpp::base::Grid.createLinearGrid().
dim = 2
grid = pysgpp.Grid.createLinearGrid(dim)

## Then we obtain the grid's
## sgpp::base::GridStorage object which allows us, e.g., to access grid
## points, to obtain the dimensionality (which we print) and the
## number of grid points.
gridStorage = grid.getStorage()
print("dimensionality:         {}".format(gridStorage.getDimension()))

## Now, we use a sgpp::base::GridGenerator to
## create a regular sparse grid of level 3.
## Thus, \c gridStorage.getSize() returns 17, the number of grid points
## of a two-dimensional regular sparse grid of level 3.
level = 3
grid.getGenerator().regular(level)
print("number of grid points:  {}".format(gridStorage.getSize()))

## We create an object of type sgpp::base::DataVector
## which is essentially a wrapper around a \c double array.
## The \c DataVector is initialized with as many
## entries as there are grid points. It serves as a coefficient vector for the
## sparse grid interpolant we want to construct. As the entries of a
## freshly created \c DataVector are not initialized, we set them to
## 0.0. (This is superfluous here as we initialize them in the
## next few lines anyway.)
alpha = pysgpp.DataVector(gridStorage.getSize())
alpha.setAll(0.0)
print("length of alpha vector: {}".format(len(alpha)))

## The \c for loop iterates over all grid points: For each grid
## point \c gp, the corresponding coefficient \f$\alpha_j\f$ is set to the
## function value at the grid point's coordinates which are obtained by
## \c getStandardCoordinate(dim).
## The current coefficient vector is then printed.
for i in range(gridStorage.getSize()):
  gp = gridStorage.getPoint(i)
  alpha[i] = f(gp.getStandardCoordinate(0), gp.getStandardCoordinate(1))

print("alpha before hierarchization: {}".format(alpha))

## An object of sgpp::base::OperationHierarchisation is created and used to
## hierarchize the coefficient vector, which we print.
pysgpp.createOperationHierarchisation(grid).doHierarchisation(alpha)
print("alpha after hierarchization:  {}".format(alpha))

## Finally, a second DataVector is created which is used as a point to
## evaluate the sparse grid function at. An object is obtained which
## provides an evaluation operation (of type sgpp::base::OperationEvaluation),
## and the sparse grid interpolant is evaluated at \f$\vec{p}\f$,
## which is close to (but not exactly at) a grid point.
p = pysgpp.DataVector(dim)
p[0] = 0.52
p[1] = 0.73
opEval = pysgpp.createOperationEval(grid)
print("u(0.52, 0.73) = {}".format(opEval.eval(alpha, p)))

## The example results in the following output:
## \verbinclude tutorial.output.txt
## It can be clearly seen that the surpluses decay with a factor of 1/4:
## On the first level, we obtain 1, on the second 1/4, and on the third
## 1/16 as surpluses.
