@section downloads__history Versions

@subsection downloads_history_200 Version 2.0.0, 2016/05/20
- Download:
  <a href="http://sgpp.sparsegrids.org/downloads/sgpp_2.0.0.tar.gz">
  sgpp_2.0.0.tar.gz</a>

As we have retructured (and significantly improved) several of the interfaces,
we switched to a new, major version. As we don't provide backwards compatibility,
we list here the most important changes:

- Massive interface change in `sgpp::base` from plain pointers to smart pointers and references
  (e.g., sgpp::base::Grid::createLinearGrid(), sgpp::base::Grid::getGenerator(), …)
- Consistent renaming of key functions in `Grid`, `GridStorage`, and `GridIndex`
  (e.g., sgpp::base::Grid::getDimension())
- Name change of global namespace from `SGPP` to `sgpp`
- Major redesign of SCons scripts, change of SCons parameters, better diagnostic output
- Add support for Clang 3.8
- Overall improvement of the code quality due to fixed Clang warnings
- Removal of single precision support and of double
- Removal of MSVC++ support
- More unit tests
- Small changes and bug fixes in code and documentation

@subsection downloads_history_110 Version 1.1.0, 2016/02/24
- Download:
  <a href="http://sgpp.sparsegrids.org/downloads/sgpp_1.1.0.tar.gz">
  sgpp_1.1.0.tar.gz</a>

New features:
- Improved code quality
- New combigrid package
- OpenCL data mining
- Improved Scons support
- Support for installation (scons install)
- More unit tests
- New optimization method (CMA-ES)
- Some refactoring in sgpp::optimization (may break compatibility)
- Test problems for sgpp::optimization restructured.

@subsection downloads_history_100 Version 1.0.0 
- Download:
  <a href="http://sgpp.sparsegrids.org/downloads/release_1.0.0.tgz">
  release_1.0.0.tgz</a>

Finally, it's out there!

Please note that release version 1.0.0 contains a major restructuring.
Interfaces have been redesigned, factory methods restructured,
and a lot of improvements have been done.

Important changes that might cause side-effects in codes using
previous versions include:
- There are entirely new parameters for compilation.
  Please see <tt>scons -h</tt> for further information.
- Some of the Grid classes have been renamed.
  This affects especially the boundary-based grids.
  LinearBoundaryGrid is now the grid with the same
  discretization on the boundary as on the main axis.

Features of Release Version 1.0.0:
- Automatic check for requirements in SCons for compilation
- Full module support
- Release of further and extended modules
  (optimization, pde, solver, datadriven, …)
- Extended parallelization support
- New types of basis functions
- More documentation, especially on adaptive refinement
- And much more…
