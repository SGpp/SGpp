/**
@page styleguide Styleguide for SG++

@section intro Introduction
Please read through this before starting to code!
(The styleguide has been adapted partially from [1])

@section comments Comments
The complete code has to be commented elaborately. The comments,
together with the identifiers, have to enable others to familiarize
quickly with the code. Header files have to be commented
completely. In source files it suffices to comment the codelines. The
comments have to be verbose enough so that one can understand what is
going on without reading the code!
