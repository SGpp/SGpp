@section mainpage_overview Overview

SG++ is a toolbox allowing to employ spatially adaptive sparse grids
straightforward, flexibly, and without the vast initial overhead that
has to be spent when implementing sparse grids and the corresponding
algorithms. To be able to deal with different kinds
of problems in a spatially adaptive way—ranging from interpolation
and quadrature via the solution of differential equations to
regression, classification, and more—a main motivation behind the
development and all considerations was to create a toolbox which can
be used in a very flexible and modular way by different users in
different applications.

The main features of the sparse grid toolbox are efficiency and
flexibility, both of which can sometimes be nasty rivals, for example
if the reusability of an algorithm for different purposes requires
extra data structures or control mechanisms, thus slowing down special
algorithmic variants. To ensure performance at run-time, we use C++
for all performance critical parts. Considering flexibility, we have
spent a great deal in ensuring modularity, reusability and the
separation of data structures and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide
the means to use the SG++ toolbox from within Python, MATLAB, Java,
and C++, of course.

To name a few special features:
- Different types of basis functions are supported which enable to
cope with the characteristics of special applications.
- Modern shared-memory multi-core systems are supported to
speed-up computations for some performance critical operations.
- Adaptive refinement criteria can easily specified as functor
objects.
- The underlying data structure (which is, per default, hash-based)
is encapsulated so that it can be exchanged by other choices.
- Template-based support for fast realizations of typical sparse-grid
algorithms are provided that make use of the tensor product structure of the
underlying basis.

SG++ is open source software and delivered as source code. For
questions, contributions, and requests, please <a
href="mailto:dirk.pflueger@ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de">contact us</a>.

The documentation of the SG++ toolbox is structured in two main parts.
The first one, @ref manual, is dedicated to users of SG++.
For example, installation instructions are provided as well
as short use cases as a quick start to using SG++.

The second one, @ref development, addresses all those who
want to contribute to SG++ or who are involved in its
development. There, the styleguide can be found, references to useful
tools and utilities are provided, and a few current issues are gathered.

You can find these pages and more in the <b>menu to the left</b>.
If you do not see a menu, JavaScript is deactivated. 

Though we do not guarantee for anything, and though we do not have the
money to provide quick and fast support,
we are happy about any comments, recommendations,
hints on missing information, …
