@page modules Modules

To insure extendability and maintainability, SG++ is divided into a
number of modules that implement different functionality. Different
modules can be \ref linux_compilation_configuration "compiled independently from each other".


<!--
SG++ is grouped into several modules. This ensures
- Modularity - not all parts are required for every task
- Usability - not everything has to be compiled every time
- Flexibility - only parts of SG++ can be shipped
- Correctness - at least to some degree; if some part is modified, it will not influence others
- â€¦

The modules can depend on each other. Especially all depend on the base module.
Libraries are generated for all modules. The following modules are available:
