/**
@page modules Description of Modules

SG++ is grouped into several modules. This ensures
- Modularity - not all parts are required for every task
- Usability - not everything has to be compiled every time
- Flexibility - only parts of SG++ can be shipped
- Correctness - at least to some degree; if some part is modified, it will not influence others
- â€¦

The modules correspond to the corresponding namespaces in C++. Roughly, all files belonging to a namespace belong to the respective module. But a module can contain files belonging to some another namespace, especially static factory methods in the namespace sgpp::op_factory.

The modules can depend on each other. Especially all depend on the base module.
Libraries are generated for all modules. The following modules are available:
