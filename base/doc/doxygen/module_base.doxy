- different types of basis functions (piecewise linear/polynomial, B-splines, pre-wavelets, â€¦)
- the underlying data structures
- data types (sgpp::base::DataVector and sgpp::base::DataMatrix)
- basic operations such as hierarchization and dehierarchization
- evaluation and evaluation at multiple data points
- adaptive refinement
- refinement specified via functors
- quadrature
- basic OpenMP support
