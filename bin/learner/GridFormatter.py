from bin.utils.GzipSerializer import GzipSerializer

## Provides functionality for the runtime serialization of the Grid object
#
# This design intends to separate the binary object representation and its
# business logic from the text representation that can be saved into file.
# The class is a part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern" 
# target="new">Memento design pattern</a> described in details in @link 
# bin.controller.CheckpointController.CheckpointController CheckpointController
# @endlink.
#
# However strict separation of grid object and its representation is not 
# implemented,as Formatter becomes from Grid object not a GridMemento object, 
# but a string serialization of Grid itself. So Grid plays the role of 
# GridMemento. The complete decoupling is a subject for future work.
#
# @todo Bring serialization and deserialization of the Grid object in GridMemento object
