## Abstract class for solution of system of linear equations. 
#
# The class defines the methods that have to be implemented in class of with 
# routines for solution of linear equations in order to be used with SGPP.
# 
# The class also implements the subject of <a href="Observer_pattern" target="new">the observer
# design pattern</a>.
#
# @section Observer design pattern 
# To customize the processing of progress information in SGPP the observer pattern 
# is used. The classes that want to be informed about events should implement SolverEvenController
# and subscribe by the instance of LinearSolver subclass with 
# <code>attachEventController()</code>. After some event of LinearSolverEvents
# arise, LinearSolver object calls method <code>handleSolvingEvent()</code> by 
# all subscribers. As subscribers get a reference to the LinearSolver object, 
# they can retrieve the attributes of the solver and process the information.
#
# <i>Roles</i>
# - Subject: LinearSolver
# - Concrete subject: e.g. CGSolver
# - Observer: SolverEventController
# - Concrete Observer: e.g. InfoToScreen
#
# Observer can also want to retrieve the process information from Learner. See documentation of
# @link bin.learner.Learner.Learner Learner@endlink for more information.
