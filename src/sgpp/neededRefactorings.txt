This file contains needed refactorings, due to the integration of the Black Scholes PDE Solver
==============================================================================================

- find better name for the classification subfolders: e.g. datadriven
- find better name for finance subfolders: e.g. PDE with subfolders common and finance, were needed
- rename AlgorithmDGEMV to a better name (NOT Algorithm B)
- find some template implementation of GetAffectedBasisFunctions and AlgorithmDGEMV to avoid code copying
- integrate test_dataset into a class
- howto integrate the BoundingBox efficiently?
- UpDown Test facilities fix in code?
- how to name the 1D Operations (algorithm_sweep for every basis)?
		- Phi Phi -> LTwo ?
		- dPhi dPhi -> LTwoGradient ?
		- x^2 dPhi dphi -> SqXLTwoGradient ?
		- x dPhi Phi -> ???
		- x Phi Phi -> ???
- how to name the Operations on the gird?
		- Laplace -> Laplace ! (In folder PDE)
		- RiskfreeRate -> LTwoNorm ? (In folder common)
		- OperationDelta -> leave that way store in Folder finance with in folder PDE
		- OperationGamma -> leave that way store in Folder finance with in folder PDE
- find general scheme for UniDirGradient
- find a way to group the different operations, e.g. derive some special Grids that inherit 
  everything of the classical grid object. The basis bounded grids use multiple inheritance
  in order to implement the different special grids; therefore it's necessary to use virtual
  basis classes.
